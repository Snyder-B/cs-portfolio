1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by translating them into clear, actionable requirements that define what users want to achieve. Creating user stories connects high-level goals with technical solutions by putting requirements in the user’s perspective. This keeps the program focused on real-world needs and user experience. User stories also help prioritize features and ensure each sprint delivers meaningful value.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs, I start by gathering requirements, then use iterative design and feedback to refine solutions. Agile practices like sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives keep teams focused and adaptable. Moving forward, I plan to use incremental development, backlog refinement, and test-driven development to stay flexible and maintain high software quality. These methods enable teams to respond to change and keep all stakeholders informed.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in software development drives success through clear communication, collaboration, and accountability. This means welcoming feedback, assisting teammates, and valuing diverse viewpoints. In Agile, strong teamwork is essential because every sprint’s success depends on mutual support and shared goals. Effective team members not only complete their own work but also help the whole team deliver value to the client.
